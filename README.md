### :star: Project Criteria: <a name="criteria"></a>
- User can search for a city using the OpenWeather API.
- User's result shows current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast.
- Current weather includes a UV index whose color changes based on whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- User's city search history is viewable.
- User's most recent city search is stored in `localStorage`.

### :mountain: Challenges: <a name="challenges"></a>
- A final criteria was to make the search history 'researchable' - ie, when User clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with the weather results for that city. Everything I tried at the time was incredibly buggy, but I will revisit this code in the future.

### :heart: Contributions: <a name="contributions"></a>
- Weather icons were created by Graphic Designer Ashely Jacer and can be found at [manifestinteractive's GitHub repo](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons)
